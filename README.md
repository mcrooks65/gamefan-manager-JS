# gamefan-manager-JS
This is an extension to the webapp called Game Fan Manager made for the AJAX/Rails project at the Flatiron School.

It shows how asyncronous javascript can improve the speed and usability of a webapp by avoiding a constant need for http requests.

This web application stores Developers, Games, and Fans

Fans can vote on their favorite Games, and thus determine who the most popular Developer is!
